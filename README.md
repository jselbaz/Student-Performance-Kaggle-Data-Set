## Installation
The only libraries needed to run this code are the standard ones in Data Science: Python 3.X, Jupyter, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, SKLearn, and Seaborn

## Project Description
I used the Kaggle dataset about Student Performance in Math over the course of 3 years to try to better understand the following:
  1. What are the primary controllable factors that affect math performance?
  2. What are the primary external factors that affect math performance?
  3. Do these factors change across the 3 years? Do some exert a stronger influence early on and fade while others have the opposite effect? 

## File Description
There are 3 jupyter notebook available to explore answers to each of the questions posed above.

## Results
The conclusions reached can be found at the post here:
